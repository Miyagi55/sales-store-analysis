# Sales Data Analysis for a Large Store Chain

## Project Overview

This project performs a **year-long sales analysis** for a store chain operating in **11 different locations** within a specific region. The analysis processes sales data spread across multiple Excel files, each containing multiple sheets, to extract key insights:

1. **Monthly Sales Average** for all stores.
2. **Identification of the two highest** and **two lowest performing stores** per month.
3. **Visualization of sales trends** via tables and graphs.
4. **Detection of peak sales periods** to understand seasonality.
5. **Compilation of results into a new summarized Excel file**.

## Methods Used

### 1. **Data Extraction & Processing**

- **Multiple Excel files** (`.xlsx`) are loaded, with each file corresponding to a specific month.
- Each file contains sheets representing **different store locations**.
- Sales data is extracted from each sheet, **skipping header rows and selecting the relevant column**.
- The extracted data is summed to compute total sales per store.

### 2. **Parallel Processing**

- The script utilizes **ThreadPoolExecutor** to accelerate reading multiple sheets simultaneously.
- The `functools.partial` function helps **parallelize Excel reading tasks**.

### 3. **Statistical Analysis**

- **Average monthly sales** across all stores are calculated.
- Each monthâ€™s **highest and lowest performing stores** are identified.

### 4. **Data Storage & Output**

- A **new Excel file** (`monthly_sales_summary_2024.xlsx`) is created.
- It contains **two sheets**:
  - **Monthly Averages** â€“ A summary of sales averages.
  - **Store Details** â€“ Monthly sales per store, organized in a tabular format.
- Auto-adjusts column widths for better readability.

## Dependencies

### Packages That Need to Be Installed Directly

These are standalone libraries that you need to install explicitly:

- `colorama` â€“ Handles colored text in the terminal.
- `numpy` â€“ A fundamental package for numerical computing.
- `openpyxl` â€“ Reads/writes Excel files (XLSX format).
- `pandas` â€“ Data analysis and manipulation tool.
- `tqdm` â€“ Provides progress bars in loops and terminal output.
- `xlsxwriter` â€“ Writes Excel files (alternative to openpyxl).

## How to Run the Analysis

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python installed along with the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install pandas openpyxl
```

### Running the Script

```bash
python sales_analysis.py
```

### Expected Output

- A **summary Excel file** (`monthly_sales_summary_2024.xlsx`) containing:
  - **Monthly average sales**.
  - **Individual store sales per month**.
  - **Auto-adjusted column formatting**.

## Insights & Findings

- The analysis helps the client **identify peak sales months** and **underperforming stores**.
- **Seasonal trends** can be visualized through the graphs.
- **Business strategies** can be adjusted based on high and low performers.

---

## Future Improvements

- Automate **data collection from multiple years**.
- Implement **interactive dashboards** for real-time sales monitoring.
- Expand the analysis with **predictive models** for future sales forecasting.
